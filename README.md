# Pneumonia-Detection
Pneumonia, an interstitial lung Disease that effects the children’s and elders which also sometimes be a life threatening. It may affect one or both lungs in humans. One in three deaths in India are caused due to Pneumonia as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). The aim is to detect and classify patients affected by Pneumonia based on their chest X-rays which will be helpful for treating the disease without any delay mainly in remote areas. Deep learning  models automate this process as Convolutional Neural Networks (ENNW) have gained much attention for disease classification ResNet50 model which is a multilayer convolution neural network having residual blocks is used for training. This proposed model could help in detecting the disease by training the model by using chest X-rays thus, efficient results can be chained by deep learning models to classify the chest X – rays for the detection of Pneumonia.
